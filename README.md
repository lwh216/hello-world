# hello-world
Hi! I am an avid coffee drinker, tennis player, podcast listener and an enthusiast of rooftops, subway trains that arrive on time and fresh powdery snow for a day of snowboarding. Currently live in Murray Hill but moving to Williamsburggg! Just kidding, I do live in New York though and therefore have watched Broad City. This is my first GitHub project and hopefully not my last.
